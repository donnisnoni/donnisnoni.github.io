Finally, I just created my site!
It&amp;rsquo;s almost five years since the first time I learn programming and web development.
I started learning programming back in 2015 at STIKOM Uyelindo College. I learn so many things, from learning algorithm &amp;amp; programming with Pascal in the first semester, learn Web Design in the 2nd semester, learn PHP and Database in the 3rd semester, learn Object Oriented Programming with Java in the 4th semester, and learn System Programming with C++ in the 5th semester.</description></item></channel></rss>
