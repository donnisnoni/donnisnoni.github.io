**Hello...**

<!-- My name is _Don Nisnoni_, you can call me _Don_. I'm a software developer from Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©. I mostly do full-stack web development. -->

Hi there! My name is _Don Alfons Nisnoni_. I'm a software developer from Indonesia.

I mostly do full-stack web development on my daily programming activity. I learn web development since 2015 when web programming lecture is introduced to me on my campus. By the way I prefer to be called as a software developer rather than web developer because I'm also experienced and open to do another kinds of programming. But to be honest, I'm more experienced as a web developer.

### Education Background

A computer science bachelor's degree graduation from [STIKOM Uyelindo Kupang](http://uyelindo.ac.id).
I studied there for 8 semesters starting from august 2015 to december 2019 and then graduated in November 2020 with a GPA of **3.4**.
