Finally, I just created my site!

It's almost five years since the first time I learn programming and web development.
I started learning programming back in 2015 at STIKOM Uyelindo College.
I learn so many things, from learning _algorithm & programming_ with _Pascal_
in the first semester, learn _Web Design_ in the 2nd semester,
learn _PHP and Database_ in the 3rd semester,
learn _Object Oriented Programming_ with Java in the 4th semester,
and learn _System Programming_ with C++ in the 5th semester.
That was a hard time but it brings me here, in this tech world.
So thank's to all my lecturer's.

### The Final Semester

Journey's continue! In the final semester,
we have to do an internship at the local government office.
That was a very good internship experience,
I learned a lot about how to work in government offices.
I helped a lot in repairing damaged computers and cleaning computers from viruses,
and even helped them make PowerPoint presentations.
