I started learning programming back in 2015 at STIKOM Uyelindo College.
I learn so many things, from learning <em>algorithm & programming</em> with <em>Pascal</em>
in the first semester, learn <em>Web Design</em> in the 2nd semester,
learn <em>PHP and Database</em> in the 3rd semester,
learn <em>Object Oriented Programming</em> with Java in the 4th semester,
and learn <em>System Programming</em> with C++ in the 5th semester.
That was a hard time but it brings me here, in this tech world.
So thank&rsquo;s to all my lecturer&rsquo;s.</p><h3 id=the-final-semester>The Final Semester</h3><p>Journey&rsquo;s continue! In the final semester,
we have to do an internship at the local government office.
That was a very good internship experience,
I learned a lot about how to work in government offices.
I helped a lot in repairing damaged computers and cleaning computers from viruses,
and even helped them make PowerPoint presentations.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
