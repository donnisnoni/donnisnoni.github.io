But I never think of making my own site/blog. Finally, I got it in 2021 ü•≥.</p><p>So, in my first post, I will tell my story when the first time I learn programming üë®‚Äçüíª.</p><p>I started learning programming back in 2015 at STIKOM Uyelindo College.</p><h2 id=before-goto-college>Before goto College</h2><p>It all started when I didn&rsquo;t finish my education in high school.
Yes, I was expelled from school because I didn&rsquo;t go to school for almost a month.
BTW I went to high school in engineering and majored in building construction.
The reason I went there was that I liked to draw, then a friend of my stepfather
suggested that I go there.</p><p>Things are not going well, I feel like this is not something
I want and it is not something I am passionate about.
It ended up being very uncomfortable for me to go to school again.
Moreover, there were many influences from my friends who asked me to skip classes.
In the end, I was expelled and I took a package exam to get a class C high school
diploma so I could continue at a private university.</p><blockquote><p><strong>In our country, people with a class C diploma cannot continue
their education at public universities.</strong></p></blockquote><p>So I spent two years tinkering with computers, well&mldr; this is my hobby since
I was 7 years old. Sadly, I didn&rsquo;t have a computer/laptop at that time,
so every week I went to the internet cafe to study computers.</p><p>After those two years passed, suddenly my stepfather put me in one of the
computer science colleges in my city. Suddenly he said &ldquo;get ready,
tomorrow you have to go to college&rdquo; and I was like &ldquo;what?&rdquo; but honestly
I&rsquo;m excited about this.</p><h2 id=first-lecture-in-the-first-semester>First lecture in the first semester</h2><p>It was a beautiful day for me at that time, coming to campus and very
excited for the first lesson.</p><p>Our first lecture was <strong><em>&ldquo;Graphic Design&rdquo;</em></strong>.
Well, I&rsquo;ve never learned this before (although I have a hobby of the drawing).
I thought it would be hard but like people say, &ldquo;Everything is easy if you study
and try&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s really fun even though we only learn the basics.</p><h2 id=finally-the-programming-lessons>Finally, The Programming Lessons</h2><p>I look forward to seeing this course on my class schedule.
This course sounds very interesting when I see it.
The name of the course is <strong><em>&ldquo;Algorithm and Programming&rdquo;</em></strong>.
I was so excited that we finally got into the computer lab.</p><p>After the lecturer introduced himself, we were told to open the computer
and asked to run a program called FPC (Free Pascal Compiler).
When I first opened it, I was a little confused,
this program looks bad, unlike other applications I have opened before.</p><h3 id=the-algorithm>The Algorithm</h3><p>The first thing the lecturer explained was algorithms, he said,
this was the most important thing in computer programming.</p><p>The algorithm itself <strong><em>" is a step by step structured to solve a problem"</em></strong> he said.</p><p>Then he explained the diagrams in algorithms and gave us small exercises for
solving a problem topic and steps for solving them.</p><h3 id=first-program>First Program</h3><p>We simply displayed a text to screen,
simply display <em>&ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;</em> but I was happy about that,
it looks cool ü§©!</p><pre><code class=language-pascal data-lang=pascal>program Hello;
begin
  writeln ('Hello, world.');
end.
</code></pre><p>After that, we studied <strong><em>data types</em></strong>, <strong><em>function</em></strong>, <strong><em>variables</em></strong>, and <strong><em>procedures</em></strong>.
It gets even more fun knowing them. After facing a few errors,
I finally got it. But it can be said that Pascal is very disciplined and verbose,
so some of my friends always get errors from the compiler until the class is finished.
That&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t pay close attention when the lecturer explains. yeah,
that&rsquo;s expected to happen üòÅ.</p><h3 id=first-assignment-of-programming-lecture>First Assignment of Programming Lecture</h3><p>Finally, the lecturer gave us the task of making a program to display our biodata,
it was very simple but almost all of my classmates asked me to help üòÅ.
It seemed they had no intention of being able to program computers and
I was concerned about that because our tuition was a bit expensive.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Learning programming for the first time is a bit scary,
especially if you learn a strict and disciplined programming language like Pascal.
In my experience, you must have the intention,
be diligent, focus, and never give up, especially when you get an error.
A programmer has to get used to errors, this is like our daily food. Oh yes,
the most important thing is the algorithm. So, if you&rsquo;re new to programming,
keep learning and keep getting curious because
